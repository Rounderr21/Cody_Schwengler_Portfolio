# Portfolio-of-the-Future23

# Project Description

This product entales the inner working of a full stack developer. These include the projects and things they have learned up until this point. The technologies used are fundamental in nature to help strenthen their skills. Challenges that they faced are trying to use Flexbox and apply it to the proper elements to allow the portfolio to work on any screen. They would like to implement more advanced skills such as javascript to this project once they have learned it. 

When you open the project you are presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links located in the header to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. If you click one of the links in the header it will take you to the corresponding section. In the work section you have titled images of the developer's Projects. If a project link is clicked it will deploy the proper application. If you attempt to resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you will be shown a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.

# HTML File
Created source code from scratch to devlop a portfolio that potential employers may see or use to hire this individual. Used semantic HTML tags to ensure a well-structed document. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read.

# CSS File
Created ID's, Classes, and many more elements to ensure the HTML file can be presented favorably while presented to potential employers. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read, and to inform them of where the elements are being used.

# Images
Installed images to the local folder to be used in the HTML and CSS.

# Github
Pushed out commits of the HTML, CSS, and README when finishing any coding edits, as to ensure I could go back at anytime to earlier designs if need be.

# Future Development
It will include REACT and get rid of all of htmls. also use backend like express to make correct routes to each react page.
